Blog about my journey in Data Science

The plan for this blog is to take you on my journey as a Data Science with small projects that can be done as you learn more and more about the field. I personally learned better by practicing then by theory so I figured I am not the only one who has that learning style. I hope these projects can help give those out there that are just starting their journey in Data Science that extra guidance they need.

Each notebook will have explanation as to how I approached the problem at hand. I will be using Python as my prefered programming language. For those unfamiliar with python a good start would be taking the course found in DataCamp:
