Blog about my journey in Data Science

The plan for this blog is to take you on my journey as a Data Science with small projects that can be done as you learn more and more about the field. I personally learned better by practicing then by theory so I figured I am not the only one who has that learning style. I hope these projects can help give those out there that are just starting their journey in Data Science that extra guidance they need.
